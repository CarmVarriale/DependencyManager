# Dependency Manager for MATLAB

This MATLAB class provides utility functions to manage and check dependencies required for executing MATLAB scripts. It allows users to:

- Check if required MATLAB toolboxes are installed.
- Identify dependencies of MATLAB files.
- Read and write dependency lists to a file.

## Installation
Clone this repo to a local folder with the following command in the terminal:
```
   git clone https://github.com/CarmVarriale/DependencyManager
```

Add it to your MATLAB path with the following command in MATLAB's command window:
```matlab
addpath("path/to/DependencyManager");
```

## Dependencies
There are no external dependencies.

Matlab toolbox dependencies are indicated in the `DEPENDENCIES.txt` file.
This file has been generated by executing the following one-line command:
```matlab
DependencyManager.writeDeps(DependencyManager.findDeps("@DependencyManager/**"))
```


## Usage

### 1. Check if a Dependency is Installed
To check if a MATLAB toolbox is installed:

```matlab
isInstalled = DependencyManager.isDepInstalled("Simulink");
```

For multiple dependencies:

```matlab
isInstalled = DependencyManager.isDepInstalled(["Aerospace Toolbox", "Curve Fitting Toolbox"]);
```

### 2. Find Dependencies of MATLAB Files
To analyse the dependencies required for executing a file or a set of files:

```matlab
dependencies = DependencyManager.findDeps("myScript.m");
```

For multiple files:

```matlab
dependencies = DependencyManager.findDeps(["script1.m", "script2.m"]);
dependencies = DependencyManager.findDeps([ ...
				fullfile(root, "file.m");
				fullfile(root, "library\**\*.m");
				fullfile(root, "library\**\*.slx")]);
```

Using wildcards to scan folders:

```matlab
dependencies = DependencyManager.findDeps("myFolder/*.m");
```

### 3. Read Dependencies from a File
If you have a file listing dependencies (created with `writeDeps`), you can read it:

```matlab
dependencies = DependencyManager.readDeps("DEPENDENCIES.txt");
```

### 4. Write Dependencies to a File
To save the list of required dependencies for future reference:

```matlab
DependencyManager.writeDeps(dependencies, "DEPENDENCIES.txt");
```

## Example Workflow
```matlab
% Find dependencies of a script
requiredToolboxes = DependencyManager.findDeps("example.m");

% Check if all required toolboxes are installed
isInstalled = DependencyManager.isDepInstalled(requiredToolboxes);

% Save dependencies to a file
DependencyManager.writeDeps(requiredToolboxes, "DEPENDENCIES.txt");
```
